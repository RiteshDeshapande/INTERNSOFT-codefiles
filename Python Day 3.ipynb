    "\n",
    "We have learned, how to create functions with \"def\" and the \"return\" statement. In Python, Generator function allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it was left. It also allows us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a **yield** statement.\n",

The main difference is when a generator function is called and compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol. That means when they are called they don't actually return a value and then exit, the generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. \n",
